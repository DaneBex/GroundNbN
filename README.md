#GroundNbN

GroundNbN is a loose clone of AirBnB, a real estate renting app. Users can book places to stay at or post their own place for others to stay at. Every place has a location, reviews, and a price. Users can modify their places they post, their profile, and reviews they make.

This project has been a indication to my ability to be a skilled and diciplined developer. Only two full-CRUD features were required to pass given a two-week sprint, and I was able to complete that withing the first few days. I spent a large time afterwards on styling to make the app feel as lived in as possible.
